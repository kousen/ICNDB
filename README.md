Android app that accesses the Internet Chuck Norris Database

The v1 branch is the version in the Google Play store, which gets a new
joke whenever you click the button.

The master branch adds more functionality. If you click the 'Get Joke'
button, the text turns green and the joke updates every 10 seconds. Click
the button again to turn it red and turn off the updates.

The app is used in my NFJS presentations as an example of using an
AsyncTask to update the GUI.
